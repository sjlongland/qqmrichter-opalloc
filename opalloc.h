/** @file
 *  @brief An "object pool" framework for minimally-fragmenting interlaced
 *         dynamic allocation and deallocation of dynamic memory objects in C.
 *
 * In embedded and small-memory systems, excessive use of dynamically
 * allocated objects can cause heap fragmentation such that, despite there
 * being sufficient free space in the heap for an object, calls to `malloc()`
 * and related functions fail because no single block is large enough to
 * fulfill the desired request.
 *
 * This library provides an implementation of a smarter memory pool manager that
 * combats this problem by minimizing the number of interlaced allocations,
 * deallocations and reallocations at a slight expense in memory and CPU
 * overhead.  It supplies a low level interface for building custom allocators
 * in cases where fine control is needed, a high level interface for the most
 * common and simple use cases, and a macro interface for the easiest use case.
 *
 * @see https://personaljournal.ca/qqmrichter/dynamically-static-allocation-in-embedded-systems

/** @defgroup llinterface Low-level interface
 *
 * This is the nuts-and-bolts interface to the library.  It is primarily used to
 * implement the high level interface and the macro interface but has been
 * exposed to enable end-users to make task-specific interfaces if they so
 * choose.
 *
 * It is strongly recommended not to use this interface directly as it is highly
 * error-prone.

/** @defgroup hlinterface High-level (Macro) interface
 *
 * @param [in] TYPE  The type of objects to be allocated.
 * @param [in] COUNT The initial object count for the allocator.
 * @param [in] MODE  The mode of the allocator (as per the low-level interface).
 *
 * The high-level interface is the intended use of this library.  The focus is
 * on a component based design where a single source file contains a single
 * component which is allocated and deallocated dynamically, thus profiting from
 * reuse to minimize fragmentation and increase amortized allocation speed.
 *
 * Each use of the `OP_HL_DECLARE_ALLOCATOR()` macro creates one type-safe
 * allocator using the starting count and mode provided.  It also creates
 * several static functions whose name invoke the given type.  For example:
 *
 *     OP_HL_DECLARE_ALLOCATOR(my_fancy_type, 4, OP_DOUBLING_CHUNK);
 *
 * This invocation results in the following static functions:
 *
 *     static inline void initialize_my_fancy_type_allocator(void);
 *     static inline my_fancy_type *allocate_my_fancy_type(void);
 *     static inline void deallocate_my_fancy_type(my_fancy_type *object);
 *     static inline void deinitialize_my_fancy_type_allocator(void);
 *
 * Low-level operations can still be used if desired, via the provided:
 *
 *     static op_allocator my_fancy_type_allocator;
 *
 * Use of all of these is precisely the same as for the low-level interface, but
 * the allocation and deallocation is type-safe.
 *
 * @note There is no real need to call the initialization function because the
 *       allocation function does that automatically on first invocation.
 *
 * @note The deinitialization function is really only needed for obsessive
 *       clean-up.
